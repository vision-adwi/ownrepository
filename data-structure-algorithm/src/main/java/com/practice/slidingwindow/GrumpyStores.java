Leetcode#1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner
Today, the bookstore owner has a store open for customers.length minutes.  Every minute, some number of customers (customers[i]) enter the store, 
and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy.  If the bookstore owner is grumpy on the i-th minute, grumpy[i] = 1, otherwise grumpy[i] = 0.  
When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for X minutes straight, but can only use it once.
Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.
