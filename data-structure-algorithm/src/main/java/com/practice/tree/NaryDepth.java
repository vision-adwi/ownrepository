Leetcode#559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree
Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).
