	 * Data structure: is a way to 'organize data' in a way that enable it to be processed in an efficient time. 
	 * Algorithm: is a set of rules to be followed to solve a problem.
	 * 
	 * Properties of Recursion:
	 * 1. Same operation is performed multiple times with different inputs.
	 * 2. In every step we try to make the problem smaller.
	 * 3. We mandatorily need to have a base condition which tells the system that when to stop the recursion.
	 * 
	 * Why Recursion:
	 * - Because it makes code easy to write(compared to iterative) whenever a given problem can be broken into similar sub-problem.
	 * - Because it is heavily used to in data structures like Tree, Graphs etc
	 * - It is heavily used in the techniques like 'Divide and Conquer', 'Greedy' and 'Dynamic Programming'.
	 * 
	 * Recursive case: Case where the function recur.
	 * Base case: Case where the function does not recur.
	 * 
	 * Algorithm: Time complexity(Notations)
	 * Omega(O)- Tighter lower bound of a given algorithm.
	 * Big-o- Tighter upper bound of a given algorithm.
	 * Theta- Decides upper bound and lower bound of an algorithm and see if both are same.
	 * Notes-Back substitutions
